OnLoad.cpp
- This handles the load and unload events automatically called.
- Simply use these events to construct and destruct our plugin wrapper class.
- The 'Plugin' class acts as our intermediary, processing all events.
- The 'AutoCarry' class manages all of our logic and receives all events.
- The 'Spell' class controls and processes the actual logic for each spell.
